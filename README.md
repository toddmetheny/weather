# Introduction
This minimalistic application has a single input UI that takes a zip code and returns the weather for the given location.

# Get started
- In order for this app to work locally you'll need an API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/. Set that key to an environment variable called `WEATHER_API_KEY`
- Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
- Run `rails s -p 3000` to start the rails server and view the application running locally at http://localhost:3000/

# Unit tests
- Run the unit test suite by navigating to the application and then running `rspec spec/`
